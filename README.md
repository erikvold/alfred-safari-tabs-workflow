The workflow allows you to search all open tabs in all open windows and selecting a result will change to the tab and focus the window.

The workflow only includes one command:

- **tabs (query)** Searches for tabs matching the specified query. Both name of the tab as well as the URL is matched. The query is optional and if no query is specified, all open tabs will be listed.

When ”hovering” over a tab in the list, you can use one of the following modifier keys or, of course, simply select the tab to bring it to focus. The modifier keys and their actions are listed below.

- **alt** Creates a new e-mail with Mail.app in which the name of the tab is the subject and the URL is included in the contents.
- **ctrl** Closes all tabs and windows but the selected tab.
- **cmd** Closes the selected tab.
